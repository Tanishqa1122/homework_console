        <h4>The console screen, also known as the command prompt or terminal, is a text-based interface in which users can interact with a computer through commands. To open it, on Windows, you can press Win + R, type "cmd," and press Enter. On Unix-based systems like Linux or macOS, you can open the terminal from the applications menu or use a keyboard shortcut like Ctrl + Alt + T.

            The console screen is used for various tasks, such as executing commands, navigating the file system, running scripts, and managing system configurations. It provides a powerful and efficient way for users to interact with the operating system and perform tasks that may be more cumbersome or complex through graphical interfaces. Programmers and system administrators often find the console screen indispensable for tasks like code compilation, file manipulation, and system maintenance.</h2>
